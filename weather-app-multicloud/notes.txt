Fixing Azure Terraform Authentication Issue

Problem:
Terraform failed with SubscriptionNotFound and MFA (AADSTS50076) errors due to an old Azure subscription.

Steps Taken:

Cleared old Azure sessions:

az account clear


Logged in with device code to handle MFA:

az login --use-device-code --tenant f76b0d7e-b9ad-4042-ba46-910bc0e7d890


Selected the correct subscription (bab909b1-28cf-4bfb-b5c3-3d8b777e2cd9).

Verified active account:

az account show --output table


Updated Terraform vars with new subscription ID.

Re-ran:

terraform destroy
